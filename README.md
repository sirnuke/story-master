Introduction
============

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**NARRATOR**

StoryMaster is a human friendly markup for scenes, including support
for branching dialog in the style of Western RPGs made by Black Isle,
BioWare, Obsidian, et al.

**PROMPT:** Tell me more!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**CHOICE:** What's the syntax?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**NARRATOR**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basic syntax is a simple
all-caps world, called a directive.  Directives include a speaker,
which defines a line of dialog, or control elements such as this prompt.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**CHOICE:** And how is it used?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**NARRATOR**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a Ruby compiler
that translates files into Lua code.  These Lua files are executable
with a simple C runtime library.  However, all the pieces are intended
to be simple enough that any could readily be replaced.
